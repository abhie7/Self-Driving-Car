## Features

### Car Physics

The project implements car physics to simulate realistic vehicle movement and behavior within the environment.

### Road Generation using Linear Interpolation

The road generation utilizes linear interpolation algorithms to create road structures for the car to navigate.

### Collision Detection

Collision detection mechanisms are implemented to ensure the car interacts appropriately with the environment, avoiding collisions.

### Sensors - Ray Casting

The car utilizes sensors based on ray casting techniques to perceive the environment and make informed decisions based on this input.

### Adding Traffic

Traffic simulation is incorporated to introduce dynamic elements for a more realistic driving experience.

### Creating the Visualizer

A visualizer is provided to display the car's decision-making process and interactions within the environment.

### Neural Networks

The core of the project involves implementing a neural network responsible for decision-making in the simulated self-driving car.

### Genetic Algorithms

Genetic algorithms are used to optimize and train the neural network's parameters for better performance.
